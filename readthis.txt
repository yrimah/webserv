// main classes: server_storage & location_storage

//server parameters stored in server_storage class + vector of location(s)

//locations parameters are stored in location_storage

// and our servers are stored in block_conf of the class conf_parser//

//--read cmts in the webserv.cpp--//

------------------data-------------------

// go to webserv.cpp : object _parser of the class Conf_parser line 26

// object _parser has a member variable "servers" : a vector of server_storage (all the servers are stored in this members) use a loop by an iterator to get the data of each server
// You must get the data with the getters of this class "server_storage"
// And for the locations every object of "server_storage" has a member "locations" (a vector of "location_storage") where I stored the location block(s) of the server 
// to get the location data use the getters of this class "Location_storage" of every object of server_storage
